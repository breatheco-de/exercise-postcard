## `07` The first div

Now that we have our basic structure its time to add our first element inside the `<body></body>` tags.

It is recomended that most of the time the first element inside the body its a `<div>`, (div stands for division, basically they are great tools to split your website in several sections).

## 📝 Instructions

- Add a new div between the opening and closing tags `<body></body>` like this:

```html
<body>
    <div class="postcard">Hello</div>
</body>
```

- The `<div>` you added must have the `class="postcard"` because that is how we are going to refer to it later, its like assigning a name to the HTML element for later modification.

- Make sure the `<div>` tag is closed.

- Also make sure to write the word `Hello` between the opening and closing body tags.
