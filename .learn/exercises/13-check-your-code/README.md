## 📝 Instructions

1. Create a button and add it to the div with class `.postcard-footer`.
2. Apply `text-align: center;` rule to the `.postcard-footer` class, that style will help align all of the `<div>` content to the center (the button will be centered). 
3. Apply also a darker background to the button.
4. Lastly apply a padding to the button.
