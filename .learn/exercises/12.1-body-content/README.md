## `12.1` Postcard-body content

What elements should be inside the postcard body? Can you try and identify based on the HTML tags we mentioned earlier?

Possible options: Headings (h1,h2,h3, etc.), Paragraphs, Images, Divisions, Inputs, Checkbox, etc.

## 📝 Instructions

Create the neceary tags HTML tags to finish the `.post-card` content and apply the necesary styles to make them look like the picture.

Think about the layout for those tags:

1. The inputs are going to be one on top of each other.
2. The text inputs are also going to be one on top of each other.

Also think about what styles are you going to apply:

1. The first `<p>` does not need a margin top.
2. `.body-left` and `.body-right` must have padding to separate text from the edges of the boxes.
3. The inputs have a `bottom-border` in grey but no borders on the sides and top.
4. The paragraphs and/or paragraphs may have a particular `font-size`.

This is how your website should look like so far:
