## `06` Let's start building

First things first, all websites need a basic HTML template that includes one `<body>`, one `<head>`, etc. Please add the basic the following basic HTML content to your website.

### 📝 Instructions 

Delete all the previous content inside the `index.html` and paste this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- start adding new tags here -->
</body>
</html>
```

Every website starts with this skeleton, if you build your website you'll see that is white (empty) but only because the `<head>` is invisible to the website user, only tags you add to the `<body>` are visible in any website.
